# Cryptocurrency Clustering Analysis

## Overview
This project involves clustering cryptocurrencies using K-means clustering algorithm and optimizing the clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Below is a brief summary of the analysis:
- Found the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
- Clustered the Cryptocurrencies with K-Means by Using the Original Scaled Data
- Optimized the Clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Found the Best Value for k by Using the PCA Data
- Clustered the Cryptocurrencies with K-Means by Using the PCA Data
- Determined the Weights of Each Feature on Each Principal Component

## Contents:

Coding Conventions and Project Structure

## How to Interpret the Results:
1. Elbow Plot: Helps in identifying the optimal k value for clustering.
2. Scatter Plots: Visualize the clusters formed by the K-means algorithm.
3. Explained Variance: Indicates the amount of information retained in the PCA components.
4. Feature Weights: Show the contribution of each feature to the principal components, helping to understand the data structure and feature importance.

For detailed code and results, please refer to the respective Python scripts and output files in the repository.
